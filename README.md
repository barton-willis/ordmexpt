## Maxima function `ordmexpt`

This project aims to develop a new version of the Maxima function `ordmexpt`, which serves as a subroutine for Maxima's ordering predicate `great`. This rewrite specifically addresses [bug #4383: great not transitive (so simplifya not idempotent)](https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/bugs/4383/), with the goal of ensuring transitivity and idempotency in Maxima's simplification functions.
